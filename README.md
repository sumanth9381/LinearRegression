# LinearRegression
## project-title
Predict the heart attcak disease for organization whO using machine learning algorithm rate of heart attack disease will incresing manner or decressing manner
## PROBLEM STATMENT
A world heard organization estimated 12 millions Dead records. One of them half of the dead result is found in US. The research scsholer point out the most relevent risk factor of heartattack as a data science engineer predict the overall risk using machine learning algorithm is called logistic regression
##Task

1. Import the libraries which is the required for prediction.
2. Import the data set using work space.
3. Use a appropriate argument of sklearn librarie to train,test,and Split the data sets.
4. Fit your value with arrange function using future scalling.
5. Check your model accuracy and precission using confuser matrix.

### Conclusion
according to the model analysis the logisticregression algorithm work suuccesfully with 0.6 accuracy. the accuracy shows that building the model is succesful.
